Hello!!! 
My name is Fernando Balbina and this is my Portfolio.
As a Researcher, I have applied my skills and knowledge in programming, data analysis and computational modeling to multidisciplinary research projects 
aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. I have worked on the optical characterization of photosensitive drugs, using laser beam modulation
techniques and spectral methods to assess their efficacy and safety. I also hold a master's degree in computational modeling, where I developed a new application 
for a deterministic approach to the spectral method on neutron shielding problems.
Prior to that, I gained valuable experience in contract management, project planning, maintenance, audits, and budgeting as an Operations Coordinator. I was responsible
for ensuring the optimal performance and compliance of vessels and crew, managing maintenance activities and contracts, and addressing audit non-conformities.
