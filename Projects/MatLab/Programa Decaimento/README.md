The present work has as objective present a strategy, basic physics students focused, for the calculation of 
isotope concentrations and activities in radioactive decay chains, capable to demonstrate
the behavior of these isotopes over time, using a iterative process and basic mathematical operations.
The computational modeling of the radioactive decay problem by solving ordinary differential equation systems 
using the Runge-Kutta Fourth Order numerical method is approached. The adopted physical and mathematical models 
are shown, as well as their computational application to four radioactive decay chains: Thorium Series, 
Uranium Series, Actinium Series, Neptunium Series and Artificial Series.
